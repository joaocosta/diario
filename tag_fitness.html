<p>I tried wearing my polar heart rate monitor for a over 12 hours, including overnight.  It did keep track of my heart rate, and I am able to look at the chart on the Polar app on my phone.</p>

<p>It is possible to export the Polar data, altough the process to do so is somewhat cumbersome.  It requires logging in to the polar account on the web and using some sort of GDPResque option they have to export data, which is possible but not great.</p>

<p>But perhaps an even bigger problem is, the strap of the heart rate monitor is not built to be worn for such long periods.  After a few hours of wearing it I could feel it loosing elasticity.  I imagine after not too long, it will begin to come loose and when that happens, the accuracy of the heart rate measurements would certainly drop.</p>

<p>So yeah, my existing strap is useful for monitoring heart rate during exercise, and that is precisily what it was built for, but it won't be useful as a continuous heart rate monitor for those two reasons, it's not simple to export data, and it has poor durability as a continuous heart rate monitor.</p>

<p>Today I am thinking about getting a continuous heart monitor.  I am thinking about something I can use for swimming.  There seem to be two kinds, chest strap and watch based.</p>

<p>But really, before I start spending money, I should just use the Polar chest strap I already have, and see how I can start storing that data somewhere.</p>
